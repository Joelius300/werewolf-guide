# Werewolf Guide

This is a collection of rules and roles for the social deduction game Werewolf (Mafia) as I and my friends often play it, packaged in a PWA.  
I use it as reference for the players and myself when hosting larger games. I'm swiss so the content is written in german, with some swiss-german thrown in at some places.  
Maybe I'll also translate it into english later on just because I love this game.

## Site analytics

I'm using [Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io) to analyze the usage of the site while fully respecting the privacy of the users. I'm firmly against handing over tracking data to Google by using Google Analytics and am grateful that Plausible created a simple, open source and privacy-friendly alternative that doesn't come from the adtech world. It allows web developers to improve their site through analytics without selling their and most importantly their users souls to Google. To add one more level of transparency, everyone can look at all the collected data on my [Plausible Dashboard](https://plausible.io/joelius300.github.io%2Fwerewolf-guide).
