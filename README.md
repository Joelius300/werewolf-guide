# Werewolf Guide
This is a collection of rules and characters for the social deduction game Werewolf (Mafia) as I and my friends often play it.  
I use it as reference for the players and myself when hosting larger games. I'm swiss so the content is written in german, with some swiss-german thrown in at some places.  
Maybe I'll also translate it into english later on just because I love this game.

## Implementation
After trying to use [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) (awesome tool btw) I found [VuePress](https://v2.vuepress.vuejs.org/) with TypeScript and decided to switch because it was easier to create pages from JSON (at least with my knowledge), supports PWA conveniently and also has multi-lang support (which I don't even need yet). I went with vuepress@next (v2 beta) for some nice features like Vue 3, better TypeScript support, dark theme and just the latest goodies out of the box.

## Site analytics
I'm using [Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io) to analyze the usage of the site while fully respecting the privacy of the users. I'm firmly against handing over tracking data to Google by using Google Analytics and am grateful that Plausible created a fully GDPR compliant, Open Source and privacy-respecting alternative, which allows web developers to improve their site through analytics without selling your and your users souls to Google.
